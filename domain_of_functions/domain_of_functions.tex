\section{Domain of Functions}

This section deals mainly with polynomial, rational, and radical functions, as they provide the example best for obtaining an intuition for the concept of domain.

\begin{example}
We have an example of the identity function, in the attenuated domain:
\begin{align*}
    f(x) = x \hspace{20pt} x \in [-2, 2]
\end{align*}
in which the blue line represents the function, and the red line represents the $x$ values on which $f$ is acting. The collection of these $x$ values is known as the domain of $f$. Think about it as if the function $f$ is pulling $x$ from the red line to the vertical position at which $f$ wishes to settle.
